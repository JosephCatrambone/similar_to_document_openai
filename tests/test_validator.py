                Large language models (LLM) are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. 
                The underlying transformer is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. 
                The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it.
                Transformer LLMs are capable of unsupervised training, although a more precise explanation is that transformers perform self-learning. 
                It is through this process that transformers learn to understand basic grammar, languages, and knowledge.
